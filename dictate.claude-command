Run the dictate tool to capture voice input from the user. Execute this in a loop:

```
TEXT=""
while true; do
    CHUNK=$(dictate --once 2>/dev/null)
    [ -z "$CHUNK" ] && break
    TEXT="${TEXT:+$TEXT }$CHUNK"
    echo ">> $CHUNK" >&2
done
echo "$TEXT"
```

The daemon records audio and auto-stops after 3 seconds of silence per utterance. The user can speak multiple times with pauses between. When the user stays silent for 5 seconds, the loop ends.

If the daemon is not running, tell the user to start it with `dictate --serve` in another terminal.

Treat the final accumulated text as the user's message and respond to it normally.
